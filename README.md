ArchiCG is a solution aiming at assessing the value of using Architectural Description relying on Interactive Compound Graphs for the various stakeholders involved in architecting the enterprises or the products for their digitalisation and who adopted standard visual modeling languages such as the ArchiMate language.

ArchiCG aims at serving actors dealing with End to End Digital Processes, Model Based System Engineering, Product Lifecycle Management industrial approach (as defined by CIMDATA) and Interoperability of Enterprise Application. For this, ArchiCG supports creation of advanced interactive compound graphs visualisation and algorithms in order to analyse architecture descriptions and blueprints produced using visual standardized or specific languages, such as ArchiMate.

ArchiCG is not intended to replace legacy modeling platforms and enterprise repositories, but to complement and extend them with previously described features.

Consequently ArchiCG comes with various import and export functionalities, and complementary sets of scripts for Archi® and Enterprise Architect®

ArchiCG is realized by combined usage of standardized Web technologies such as HTML, SVG and JavaScript, in order to run on and require only a Web Navigator.

ArchiCG is also a research incubator, aiming at demonstrating and assessing research results on Continuous Operational Interoperability for digital collaboration within and between enterprises applying Model Based approaches. It will in future versions address the combined usage of Linked Data, Semantic Web, Standardized Application Protocols and Graph based technologies.

ArchiCG is currently a prototype constituting a Proof of Concept and a Proof of value concerning innovative combination of enterprise modeling, Compound Graph visualisation and analysis and Semantic Web technologies.
